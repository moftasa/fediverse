# Potentially Useful Fediverse Files or Resources
Files related to my Fediverse presence 

## Mastodon-Accounts-Selected.csv

This is a file with 150+ mastodon/fediverse users.

Selected accounts post about:

cats, photography, jokes, memes, DIY, comics, art, music, origami, typography, transit, energy, physics, cycling, climate, gardening, nature, space photography, video games, psychology, covid, public health, history, bird webcams, travel, science, ai ethics, sustainability and of course politics.

I have also added the few arab or egyptian users[^1] that are here. Unfortunately, some of the accounts are dormant.

I tried not to select those who are posting a lot about mastodon, fediverse, linux, technology, psychiatry or neuroscience. I have also removed people who post or boost way too much as they'd overwhelm your timeline. You will end up seeing their posts inderectly anyway.

After you have created your mastodon account. Do the following:

Preferences -> Import and Export -> Import -> Browse -> choose the file provided.
